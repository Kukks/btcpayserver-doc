# Support

This project is open source, and is not a company. Instead we rely on a network of contributors and users to provide support.

Here are some members of the community that you can contact to get additional paid support:

### Hubik Tomas

> I can help with initial setup/deployment (currently with Azure, but I am planning to play with non-Azure as wll) and integration with PrestaShop. I was also playing with design customization of the payment window, scripting of exchange rates etc.

Contact: hubik.tomas@gmail.com

### Spas Vutov

> I can assist with initial configuration for BTCPay to work with Bitcoin Gold (BTG, also referred as BGold), Bitcoin Gold LND and any docker, no-docker setup for BTCPay with Bitcoin Gold. I would accept tips if the work done was useful, but definitely not mandatory for anyone to pay me for any help.
